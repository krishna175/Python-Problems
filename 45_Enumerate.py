#-----------ENUMERATE FUNCITON------------------

#A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations.
# Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.
#Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object.
# This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or be converted into a list of
# tuples using list() method.
